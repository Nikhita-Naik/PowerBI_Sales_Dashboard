# PowerBI_Sales_Dashboard

📊 RAJAT E-Commerce Sales Dashboard 

I developed an interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard in Power BI to analyze business performance across customers, regions, categories, and payment modes. The dashboard includes slicers, charts, and KPIs to provide deep insights into sales trends.

🔧 Key Functionalities

📌 KPI Cards
Displays Total Sales Amount, Total Quantity Sold, Average Order Value, and Total Profit, giving a quick overview of performance.

🧭 State Filter with Checkboxes (Multi-Select Slicer)
Added a State Slicer using Checkbox Selection to allow users to easily filter sales data by one or multiple states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat etc.
✔ Helps in easy comparison between different states
✔ Makes the dashboard more interactive and user-friendly

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Sales Analysis
A bar chart showing Sales by Customer Name, helping identify top customers and low-performing customers.

🌍 Region-wise Sales Breakdown
Horizontal bar chart for Sales by State, giving a clear view of high and low revenue regions.
🛍 Category & Sub-Category Insights

Bar chart showing Profit by Sub-Category
These visuals help understand which product categories generate the highest sales and profit.


💳 Payment Mode Distribution Donut chart showing Quantity by Payment Method including UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, COD etc., to analyze customer payment preferences.

📅 Monthly Profit Trend A column chart representing Month-wise Profit, helping identify seasonal trends, growth months, and loss periods.
